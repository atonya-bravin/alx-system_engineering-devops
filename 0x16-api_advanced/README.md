# 0x16. API advanced

## Objective
This project is basically aimed at impacting the skills of;
1. How to read API documentation to find the endpoints you’re looking for
2. How to use an API with pagination
3. How to parse JSON results from an API
4. How to make a recursive API call
5. How to sort a dictionary by value

## Requirements
* Reddit API
* Pyhton 3
* Vi

## Featured Files
1. **0-subs.py** ==> this file contains a function that queries the Reddit API and returns the number of subscribers (not active users, total subscribers) for a given subreddit. If an invalid subreddit is given, the function should return 0.
2. **1-top_****ten.py** ==> this file contains a function that queries the Reddit API and prints the titles of the first 10 hot posts listed for a given subreddit.

## Summary
A great API to use for some practice is the Reddit API. There’s a lot of endpoints available, many that don’t require any form of authentication, and there’s tons of information to be parsed out and presented. This project therefore brings into play the Reddit API.
